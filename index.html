            <h2>
                Meet Liang Tze</h2>
            <p>
                On the first day of school, some of his friends thought he would be that quiet boy sitting in the corner of the classroom. However, all that was about to change: he was an extroverted student studying at the School of Science and Technology. Moving forward in his first year, he founded Kids Learn Code in 2022 with a group of close friends, with the mission to help underprivileged children learn to code for free. 
                
                <br><br>
                He tries to volunteer at libraries while planning and participating in teaching sessions at Kids Learn Code while juggling his schoolwork. This is his way of taking a break and relaxing, as all these bring a sense of joy to him. In addition, he has a strong interest in and enthusiasm for transportation, coding and even photography, which he does in his other free time. 
                <br><br>
                
                In the future, he wants to be able to pursue his passion for engineering in civil engineering, helping to improve the transportation system in Singapore. He may also consider becoming a teacher to empower and change lives. He firmly believes that a person's life is highly dependent on the teacher, as they are the ones that shape their habits. </p>
